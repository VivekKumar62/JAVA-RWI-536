In Java, an object is an instance of a class. It is a runtime entity that represents a real-world entity with
its attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods). Objects are created using the new keyword followed by a call 
to a constructor of the class. Each object has its own set of instance variables and can invoke methods defined in its class.
public class Car {
    String brand;
    int year;
    
    public Car(String brand, int year) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.year = year;
    }
    
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("The " + year + " " + brand + " starts.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating objects of class Car
        Car car1 = new Car("Toyota", 2020);
        Car car2 = new Car("Honda", 2019);
        
        // Accessing fields and invoking methods
        System.out.println("Car 1: " + car1.brand + " " + car1.year);
        car1.start();
        
        System.out.println("Car 2: " + car2.brand + " " + car2.year);
        car2.start();
    }
}
