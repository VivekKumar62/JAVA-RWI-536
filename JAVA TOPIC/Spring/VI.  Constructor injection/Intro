Constructor injection in Spring is a form of Dependency Injection (DI) where the dependencies of a class are provided through its constructor.
This approach ensures that a class is always initialized with all its required dependencies, making it easier to enforce immutability and better testability.
Constructor Based Dependency Injection is the most recommended dependency injection technique in the Spring Framework.
This technique involves passing all necessary dependencies for an object as arguments to the constructor.
The object is created only after all necessary dependencies have been provided
