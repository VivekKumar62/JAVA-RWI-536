### Injecting Collection Types in Spring

In Spring, you can inject various collection types such as `List`, `Set`, `Map`, and `Properties` into your beans using XML configuration. Here’s a theoretical overview of how to do this for each collection type:

1. **Injecting a `List`:**
   - Use the `<list>` tag within the `<property>` tag.
   - Define each item in the list using the `<value>` tag.
   - Suitable for maintaining an ordered collection of elements.

2. **Injecting a `Set`:**
   - Use the `<set>` tag within the `<property>` tag.
   - Define each item in the set using the `<value>` tag.
   - Ideal for maintaining a collection of unique elements without duplicates.

3. **Injecting a `Map`:**
   - Use the `<map>` tag within the `<property>` tag.
   - Define each key-value pair using the `<entry>` tag, with `key` and `value` attributes.
   - Useful for storing associations between keys and values.

4. **Injecting `Properties`:**
   - Use the `<props>` tag within the `<property>` tag.
   - Define each property using the `<prop>` tag, with the property name as the tag’s key.
   - Often used for configuring key-value pairs such as settings or configuration parameters.

Each of these collection types can be injected into the corresponding properties of a bean, allowing for flexible and modular configuration of complex objects within your Spring application.
