In Java Spring, injecting a reference means providing a Spring-managed bean (an instance of a class) to another bean at runtime, allowing Spring to manage the dependencies between different components. This process is known as Dependency Injection (DI). There are several ways to inject dependencies in Spring:

Constructor Injection: Dependencies are provided through the constructor of the class.

Setter Injection: Dependencies are provided through setter methods of the class.

Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into the fields of the class.
