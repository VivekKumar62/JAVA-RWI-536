 An array is a data structure that allows you to store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. 
 Each element in an array is accessed by its index. The index of the first element is 0, the index of the second element is 1, 
 and so on. Arrays can hold primitive data types (such as int, float, char, etc.) as well as objects (which includes arrays of objects).
