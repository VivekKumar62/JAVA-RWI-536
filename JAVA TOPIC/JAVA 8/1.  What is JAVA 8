Java 8 is a major release of the Java programming language, which was released by Oracle Corporation in March 2014. It introduced several new features,
enhancements, and improvements to the Java platform, including:

1. **Lambda Expressions**: Lambda expressions provide a concise way to represent anonymous functions. They enable you to treat functionality as a method
argument or pass code in a more readable and maintainable way.

2. **Functional Interfaces**: Functional interfaces are interfaces that contain only one abstract method. They are used to support lambda expressions and 
method references.

3. **Stream API**: The Stream API introduced functional-style operations on streams of elements, allowing for more expressive and efficient ways to process
collections of objects.

4. **Default Methods**: Default methods allow interfaces to have methods with implementations, providing a way to add new methods to interfaces without 
breaking existing implementations.

5. **Date and Time API**: Java 8 introduced the java.time package, which provides a comprehensive API for date and time manipulation, addressing many 
shortcomings of the old java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar classes.

6. **Optional Class**: The Optional class is a container class that may or may not contain a non-null value. It helps in avoiding null pointer exceptions
and encourages more robust code.

7. **Functional Interfaces**: Java 8 introduced the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation to explicitly mark interfaces as functional interfaces, making the
intent clear to developers.

8. **Parallel Operations**: The Stream API introduced parallel operations, allowing for parallel execution of operations on streams, which can improve
performance for large datasets.

9. **Improved Security**: Java 8 introduced several security enhancements, including the TLS 1.2 protocol, stronger key exchange algorithms,
and improved certificate handling.

10. **Nashorn JavaScript Engine**: Java 8 included the Nashorn JavaScript engine, which provides a high-performance JavaScript runtime environment for 
Java applications.

Overall, Java 8 was a significant release that introduced several new features and improvements to the Java programming language, making it more modern,
expressive, and efficient.
