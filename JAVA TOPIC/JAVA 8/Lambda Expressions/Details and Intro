 Lambda expressions introduce a new syntax for writing concise and flexible code. A lambda expression is an anonymous function—a method 
without a name—that can be passed around as a parameter to other methods or stored in variables. Lambda expressions enable you to treat
functionality as a method argument, or as a piece of data, which allows for more concise and readable code.

Lambda expressions are particularly useful when working with functional interfaces, which are interfaces that contain exactly 
one abstract method. Lambda expressions can provide a concise way to implement the abstract method of a functional interface.
