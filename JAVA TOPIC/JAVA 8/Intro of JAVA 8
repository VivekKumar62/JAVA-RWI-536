Java 8 introduced several key features that significantly impacted Java programming. Here's a breakdown of some of the most important ones:

**1. Lambda Expressions:**

* Allow creating anonymous methods concisely.
* Useful for passing code blocks as arguments or implementing functional interfaces (explained later).
* Example:
  ```java
  (x, y) -> x + y;  // Lambda expression for addition
  ```

**2. Functional Interfaces:**

* Interfaces with a single abstract method.
* Lambda expressions can be used to implement them, promoting cleaner code.
* Example:
  ```java
  @FunctionalInterface
  interface Adder {
      int add(int x, int y);
  }
  ```

**3. Method References:**

* Provide a compact way to refer to existing methods using the colon (:) operator.
* Can be used instead of lambda expressions when they only call a single method.
* Improve code readability in certain situations.
* Example (using the Adder interface from above):
  ```java
  Adder adder = Integer::sum; // Method reference to Integer.sum(int, int)
  ```

**4. Stream API:**

* Introduced for processing collections of objects in a declarative way.
* Offers operations like filtering, mapping, reducing, etc.
* Enables concise and efficient data manipulation.
* Example:
  ```java
  List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
  numbers.stream()
         .filter(x -> x % 2 == 0) // Filter even numbers
         .forEach(System.out::println); // Print each even number
  ```

**5. Default and Static Methods in Interfaces:**

* Allow interfaces to define default implementations for methods.
* Static methods can be utility methods accessible through the interface name.
* Enhance flexibility and reusability of interfaces.
* Example:
  ```java
  interface MathOperations {
      int add(int x, int y);

      default int subtract(int x, int y) {
          return x - y;
      }

      static double PI() {
          return 3.14159;
      }
  }
  ```

**6. Optional Class:**

* Represents a value that may be present or absent.
* Helps avoid NullPointerExceptions by providing methods for handling null values safely.
* Example:
  ```java
  String name = getUser().getName().orElse("Default Name");  // Get user name or default if null
  ```

**7. Date and Time API (java.time package):**

* Replaces the old java.util.Date and Calendar classes.
* Provides a more intuitive and modern API for working with dates and times.
* Example:
  ```java
  LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();
  ```

These are some of the major features introduced in Java 8. They have transformed Java development, making it more concise, expressive, and functional.

It's important to note that Java 8 also introduced improvements to the Collection API (e.g., forEach method), Concurrency API, and I/O functionalities. You can find more details about these features in the official Java documentation or online tutorials.
