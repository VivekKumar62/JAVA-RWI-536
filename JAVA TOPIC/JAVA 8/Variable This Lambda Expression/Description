Variable This Lambda Expression :-

Lambda expressions introduce a concise way to represent anonymous functions, often used to implement functional interfaces.
The keyword this within a lambda expression refers to the enclosing instance of the class where the lambda is defined. 
This is particularly useful in situations where you need to access instance variables or methods of the enclosing class.
