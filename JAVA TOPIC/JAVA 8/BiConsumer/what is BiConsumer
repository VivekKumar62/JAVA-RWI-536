In Java 8, the BiConsumer interface is a functional interface that represents an operation that accepts two input arguments and returns no result.
It is part of the java.util.function package and is used in functional programming to perform operations that consume two inputs without producing any output.

The BiConsumer interface has a single method accept(T t, U u) that takes two arguments of types T and U, and returns void. This method is used to 
perform the operation on the two input arguments.
