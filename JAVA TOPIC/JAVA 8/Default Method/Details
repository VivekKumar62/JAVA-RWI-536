Java 8, default methods were introduced in interfaces. Default methods are methods that have a body and are declared with the default keyword. 
They allow interfaces to provide method implementations that can be used as a default if a class implementing the interface does not override them.

Default methods were introduced to enhance the functionality of interfaces without breaking existing code. They enable 
interfaces to evolve by adding new methods without forcing implementing classes to provide an implementation for the new methods.
