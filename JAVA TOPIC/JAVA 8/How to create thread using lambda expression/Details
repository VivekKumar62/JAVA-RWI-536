how to create thread using lambda expression:-

Create the Runnable interface reference and write the Lambda expression for the run() method. Create a Thread class object passing the above-created 
reference of the Runnable interface since the start() method is defined in the Thread class its object needs to be created. Invoke the start() method to 
run the thread.
