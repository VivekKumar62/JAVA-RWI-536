Decision-making statements and control statements are fundamental concepts in programming that help control the flow of execution in Java programs based on certain conditions or criteria. Here's a brief overview of each:

Decision-Making Statements:
if statement: Executes a block of code only if a specified condition is true.
if-else statement: Executes one block of code if the condition is true and another block if the condition is false.
else-if ladder: Checks multiple conditions and executes a block of code corresponding to the first true condition.
switch statement: Selects one of many code blocks to be executed based on the value of a variable.
Example (if statement):
int x = 10;
if (x > 5) {
    System.out.println("x is greater than 5");
}

    System.out.println("x is greater than 5");
}
Control Statements:
for loop: Executes a block of code a specified number of times.
while loop: Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
do-while loop: Executes a block of code at least once, and then repeats the loop as long as a specified condition is true.
break statement: Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers control to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
continue statement: Skips the current iteration of a loop and continues with the next iteration.
Example (for loop):

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
}
